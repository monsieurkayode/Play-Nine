## Codebase
This project is built using React as the front end library with no backend.
### Technologies
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù.
* [Styled-Component](https://www.styled-components.com): Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles ‚Äì using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.
## Getting Started
This section provides a quick start guide.
### Prerequisites
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/): NodeJs is a JavaScript run-time environment that uses an event-driven, 
non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you don‚Äôt ever have to worry.
